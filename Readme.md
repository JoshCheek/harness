Headcount Test Harness
======================

For testing [headcount](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount).


How to run
----------

1. Put your code in a directory named `headcount`, at the same level as this repo.
   In other words, if you did an `ls`, you should see directories for both
  `headcount` and `heacount_test_harness`.
2. Run `bundle install` (if it doesn't know what `bundle` is, then run `gem install bundler`)
3. Run `rake test:all`
